Many Spanish businesses thrive from the tourism, as the country has become one of the most popular holiday destinations in the world. Although the tourism sector has such a positive impact on the Spanish economy, due to a lack of modernisation, regulations are now outdated and scarce. During this major season for the Spanish economy, businesses are constantly finding ways to exploit their assets for further financial gain. 

‘Spill the Sauce’ is a campaign focusing on the impact that this has on the employees who are forced to succumb to various forms of worker exploitation, where job security and rights are non-existent. The campaign has been formed around a series of interviews which express the true emotions of the people affected, offering them a chance to come together, serve justice and make a change to current working conditions in the hospitality sector.",jackprowlands@gmail.com,https://jackrowlands.myportfolio.com/,@jpr_gd,2020-05-14 19:38:50,2020-05-15 21:29:43,95d239efa5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,1

This project aims to illustrate the story of re-birth, and the possibility of the end bringing a fresh, new beginning into life. This collection of work became a way to explore and cope with the personal loss of a family member, and discover how something negative can be used to fuel a show of beauty, in memory and in an educational form, understanding grief and the possibility of an afterlife. Exploring the use of paper folding techniques, the re-birth of old/discarded work into new 3-dimensional forms displays a new life after what could have been the end for the 2-dimensional work it was formed from. Inspired by the story of ‘The Secret of the Dragonfly’, this work is aiming to give hope to those grieving, whilst also supplying an immersive escapism area, where the broken is free to fly. This project paved the way for an exploration across a wide range of multi-disciplinary art techniques, pulling apart 2-dimensional forms in order to change its dimensional value.
This response shows the delicacy, but also the poignancy of life and judgement, how one may see the end or the break of something, another may notice a growing potential.

The bikes constitute mobile architectures blurring public, private, and personal space; physical indexes of global venture capital.

Dad’s been running around the house, in and out of the garden thinking that he has lost Rudi, our dog. This is a common occurrence, where Dad drives back from a dog walk, forgets he’s in the car, comes in to the house and proceeds to think that he has lost him.  My Dad, Tony, suffers with an illness called hydrocephalus, which causes him to build up too much fluid in the brain. 25 years ago Dad went in for an operation to put a hole in his head that would allow the liquid to flow. However, during the operation his short-term memory was accidentally damaged, permanently leaving him with a unique short term memory difficulty.

The Dog’s in the Car is a collaboration between the artist and her father.

Having birthed the likes of The Smiths, Oasis and New Order, the city is known for being a hub for all genres of music, with these iconic names in British pop culture not only putting Manchester on the map, but also paving the way for future generations. New emerging artists prove that Manchester’s music scene continues to thrive, rightfully earning its status as the music capital of the UK. 

In June 2019, The Institute for Public Policy Research released a report labelling Manchester’s pollution levels as “lethal and illegal”. With this in mind, how can we combine the city’s love of music with a more sustainable mode of transport to tackle Manchester’s air quality crisis?

Introducing 45RPM, Manchester’s revolutionary bike hire scheme in partnership with Spotify – celebrating the city’s rich music culture – past, present and the future. 

With its name deriving from the most common vinyl single, the 45 (and the records’ revolutions per minute) this dock-based hire scheme encourages an innovative and safe inner-city cycling experience with its fun, pedal-powered musical bikes.

So how does it work? At the turn of the bike wheel, music will be played aloud, the song’s tempo determined by the cyclist’s speed and revolutions of the pedals. Simply, the faster the pedalling, the faster the song. This ensures the recommended inner-city cycling speed is always maintained, providing a safe environment for all.",claudiaaggett@hotmail.co.uk,claudiaaggett.com,@designby.claudia,2020-05-14 13:39:22,2020-05-15 18:23:08,2e0ca3269e,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,1

Embracing these properties, I create ceramic vessels and sculptures marked by my tactile experience of sculpting the clay with my hands. The audience encounters the physical as well as visual: finger imprints, throwing rings, join lines and scoring, emphasising the artist’s hand in the creation of each individual piece. I avoid placing a narrative on the work, instead, the markings narrate the self-contained personal histories in the clay body of each vessel.

In this installation, I have assembled groups of clay objects; some clustered together, others decidedly separate, at varying heights. Inhabiting the space in this way, the unique handcrafted vessels lose their autonomy, gaining an aesthetic force within groups of related forms. Inspired by the installations of Edmund de Waal, the unusual groupings and placement of the work challenges traditional arrangements of functional ceramics with a theatrical twist.",cara.kennedy@live.co.uk,www.carakennedystudio.com,@carakennedy.studio,2020-05-15 12:31:39,2020-05-15 18:22:22,ab2f08c4de,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,1

The interactive concept extends from packaging, to a smart watch app and even an airport lounge experience. Unwinding  the full story of the brand, the consumer is invited to discover what truly goes into each bottle, while they themsleves unwind and relax. 

Playful colour and gradients embody the craft and artistry of each bottle in a dynamic and fun style true to the brand’s personality. The river Ebro, flows through the campaign. In real life, it flows through the Campo Viejo vineyard, bringing their grapes to life. To celebrate its unique qualities, its organic form is used as the visual knot that ties touch points together. 

From check in to arrival and of course on board,  Campo Viejo gives you multiple opportunities to unwind, so you can focus on the moment, and live a life more colourful.",Nattyhawkings@gmail.com,www.instagram.com/natty_designs_,instagram.com/natty_designs_,2020-05-15 16:40:11,2020-05-15 17:04:36,3a2e4ebc86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,1

Jazz and Azul inspires conversation and cooperation to encourage players to reflect on real-world issues, as it’s fundamental core is heavily influenced by the music, history and culture of jazz and blues. This coming-of-age adventure exposes players to the harsh realities caused by segregation and discrimination, whilst also emphasising how cooperation, determination and friendship can break that vicious cycle. 

What trials did Jazz and Azul face that day? How were they able to help each other on either side of the Great Divide? Were they be able to destroy the wall or did their overbearing, bigoted communities still have a hold over them?",queengamemachine@gmail.com,"Instagram/twitter= @jazzandazul, website = www.jazzandazul.com (under development) , uni games hub/other 3rd year games = https://wsagames.com/",@queengamemachine and @adam._w_ (we are a team of two!),2020-05-15 16:11:21,2020-05-15 16:21:16,3859670eb6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,1

The aim was to appeal to a new audience using any method of communication that would suit the text and my chosen concept.

Paradiso details Dante’s journey through Heaven and the series of spheres that he traverses to meet God.  Throughout Paradiso, especially within the 33rd Canto, Dante uses the imagery of light repeatedly as a metaphor for Heaven and uses the brightest light as a representation of when he meets God Himself.  Light and dark (shadow) has been used frequently throughout history to represent heaven and hell; good and bad. 

This design is based around the idea of using light and shadow to read the text from the 33rd Canto in Paradiso.  The lampshade is attached to a ceiling fitting or light stand and, once the light is switched on, the text is projected onto the nearby walls surrounding the consumer with the Canto thereby transporting the reader into the representation of Paradise.",tiacollisdesigns@gmail.com,https://tiacollis.myportfolio.com/work,tia_collis_designs,2020-05-15 15:48:17,2020-05-15 16:19:38,f36d77217f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,1

There is a lack of education for women about their bodies, sexual and vaginal health. This is apparent in all ages of development as the taboo of speaking about anything other than basic wants is carried through to adulthood. Women can become unaware of their bodies as they follow misleading information from various mediums such as online videos, television shows and even from conversations.  This is why exploring the body on a personal level allows for us to become independent in understanding both our needs and wants through our own personal boundaries. Clits, tits & other bits is a game made for all ages, genders and beliefs to allow for the societal barriers to be excused in a safe place as a community of players. The game aims to allow players to truly understand the details of the bodies which they live in or partner with.",raebonny@outlook.com,,,2020-05-15 14:05:10,2020-05-15 15:03:06,d73406f73b,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,1

Clarke explores how her materials, especially clay, interact with herself, their surrounding space and the viewer. Clarke manipulates and models clay directly, leaving evidence of the artist’s hand within the finished work.  

Clarke is fascinated by the different textures, colours and patterns within the work she produces and how they are able to allow the viewer to have an insight into her mind and her creative process. Clarke’s ceramic works exert a strong tactile feeling, therefore allowing the viewer to have a strong visual insight into how the work has been created.

Clarke uses personal memories of the sea to establish a connection with the viewer. Although Clarke’s work is heavily influenced by these memories and experiences, this is not what the artwork is necessarily focused on. These hints towards influence should be present within the artwork but still leave enough space for the viewer to have their own individual experience with Clarke’s work.",aeclarke12@gmail.com,https://www.aliceclarkeart.com/artwork,@aliceclarkeart,2020-05-15 12:31:54,2020-05-15 12:51:03,7735d9d035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,1

As I researched the story further, I was drawn to the visual impact of the headless figure of Medusa. I also wanted to expand my sculptures to a full-size figure. I was very interested in Medusa, a bronze sculpture made by Benvenuto Cellini 1545–1554. I wanted to eliminate it but also subvert the misogyny and violence in it so Medusa is reclaiming her own power of her severed head, The idea of reflection plays an important part of the myth and I have cultivated it in my art pieces to create a sense of interaction, I replaced the face with a mirror - The idea is this makes it an interactive/performative element because you as the audience become the artwork. In the title I'm playing with what is perceived to be “real'' and what is ‘stone’ or sculpt. What is alive and what is dead. Though the casting process, I destroyed or killed the original ( clay version) and yet, it came back to me in a brilliant ghostly white as though it were an apparition. Both a reference to the Greek myth, where Medusa was beheaded, only to lose the life of her body whilst her head continued to be used as a weapon, but also a reference to a digital age, where because of VR and modern advancements both in art-making, but also in a wider context of technology -it is becoming only the brain that is used, the is body obsolete.",Lily.dean2@hotmail.co.uk,https://www.instagram.com/lily.dean.art/,https://www.instagram.com/lily.dean.art/,2020-05-15 11:42:49,2020-05-15 11:48:59,786b5d15d3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,1

One was to reflect on and rethink my practice in order to build a foundation for its future, the other was to look for tactics that could help me navigate in this world which seems so excessively rich in (visual) information and possibilities. The title, Everything Is Interesting And Anything Is Possible, refers to  exactly this, this excess and abundance. Having realized the bountiful existences of interesting things and possibilities, has been about as terrifying as it has been motivating. As much as it might inspire or fuel any creation, it calls for a strategy, a direction, a narrowing down of things and for making choices. This has been the leading agenda for this project. By re-approaching my practice with critical thinking I have explored the possibilities as well as boundaries, which exist within the field of Graphic Design.

One area is single use plastics and overall plastic pollution. To combat this catastrophic effect on our environment, focusing on the ocean landscape, I developed an innovative bioplastic, utilising sweets. This material is completely biodegradable yet strong and versatile. Along with inspiration from the plastic crisis, I was inspired to create a circular design collection based on the idea of lost jewellery found lying on the ground. Being biodegradable, if my jewellery were to fall on the ground it would completely breakdown and return back into the earth, thus is assisting in contributing to solving the pollution problem.

Along with the “Sweet Bioplastic” I created, I was conscious of the material choices within the pieces. For the items that incorporated metal I used Eco-Silver, which is made from 100% recycled and scrap silver products thus environmentally friendly. By combining science and craftsmanship I wanted to create items to help, not hinder the world around us through the use and reuse of sustainable materials.",meganhamilton14@hotmail.com,https://www.etsy.com/ie/shop/MeganHamiltonDesigns,@megan_hamilton9,2020-05-14 19:50:41,2020-05-15 11:47:07,f40d61f4ac,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,2

​
What?

A short film designed to encourage more households to eat together featuring 15 households from across the UK who regularly eat meals together.

 

How? 

I asked the households to answer four questions on why and how they eat together and what they’d say to other households to also eat together.

​

Why?

Sustainability isn’t just about the environment, it’s also about keeping to a balanced and healthy lifestyle. Sometimes we just need to slow down, take it all in, and savour the hours we have together.",violetwilson@icloud.com,www.violetgracewilson.com,@violetgw,2020-05-14 15:54:33,2020-05-15 10:32:24,3897b34874,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

I have a series of images of couples in different statuses, whether they're married and have children, are engaged, have moved in together, are a new relationship or have broken up/divorced. I have held conversations with them to find out their special song or a melody and if music plays a significant role in their lives or not.

SPLIT is a 2016 American psychological-thriller movie by M. Night Shyamalan, which follows a man suffering from identity disorder, with 24 personalities identified. SPLIT heavily explores the nature of the distorted mind, on how an individual’s thought and action could be contradictive due to the conflict of many personalities.

Experimental is the new approach, exploring interactivity and pushing the boundaries away from the conventional method. This project allows the audience to experience the intense yet complex mind of the main character. There are 2 versions available, both interactive and conventional for the audience to explore the potential of this experimental approach. The title sequence is a glimpse of how these personalities intertwine with the real world as portrayed by M. Night Shamalan.",fm.cindyk@gmail.com,http://see-works.com/split/,see.works,2020-05-15 8:02:47,2020-05-15 8:08:54,124d504987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,1

The collection is digitally printed onto a range of materials, from thick linens to delicate satins, to achieve unique statement prints.

As a person of Singaporean and British heritage my practice engages with the colonial connotations of the relationship between the East and West. This is most evident in themes such as Orientalism and the Chinoiserie in which elements of Chinese design were re-imagined in relation to European aesthetics and tastes. My practice touches upon this collision of cultures, both on a personal and political level. 
This year I have been creating furniture-like structures. Combining motifs and imagery from Chinese and European furniture design, I attempt to somewhat re-imagine and reclaim these practices that have had problematic colonial undertones. Cultural designs are shared as opposed to appropriated. These objects are composed of a combination brightly coloured MDF and light reflecting materials such as acrylic, often strung with silky fabrics. 
An important element of my practice relates to the functionality of these objects, experimenting with functional flat-pack design has become quite a playful process. This experimentation results in peculiar yet dynamic transformations of seemingly simple furniture structures. Playing with light and shadow enables each structure to be seen in a new way, the cut out design of each furniture piece lends itself to this kind of experimentation, where the shadows created by a setting sun or coloured light often complete the work.",hannahlim1998@gmail.com,https://www.hannah-lim.co.uk/,https://www.instagram.com/__hannahlim__/,2020-05-14 19:44:01,2020-05-14 20:38:05,e0b8e74dc6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,1

Finally, Atropos addresses a not-much-discussed phenomena - the existence of disabled people as sexual entities. In most regards I am like any other 21-year-old woman, including my sexuality. Yet I am still met with shock and confusion when I speak about enjoying sex, every Tinder date I go on leads to; ""so... why do you need a wheelchair?"". I am seen as a useless, sexless lump, discarded on the floor. The opportunity to be sexual or vulnerable only seems the same when I leave my disability at the door, swapping my wheelchair or cane to walking unaided, concealing my struggle and identity to pretend I am ""normal"" - see, ablebodied - for a night.

Using the clinical setting of the gallery space in this way, allows the work to be analysed truly objectively.

Relationships are hard. They start off with the best intentions. Excitement, attraction, and convenience lure you in. As time goes by some relationships
can become toxic, on both sides. But old habits are comfortable and despite the long term implications, you often stay in the relationship.
This campaign capitalises on the language of break ups and uses intimate relationships as a metaphor for consumerist culture. It aims to encourage young people to take action by ‘breaking up’ with old habits and ‘move on’ to a more sustainable lifestyle.

This project is based on the experience of tropical fish farming that I have spent for 14 years. My first-round tropical fish breeder in northern China. I specialize in artificial breeding and disease control of tropical fish for Pterophyllum. I am eager to extend the meaning of the influence of spiritual support on individuals. In the works, I tried to combine the linear expression of Chinese traditional painting techniques with the mechanical form, hoping to convey surrealism with oriental characteristics through the works. I hope that these ""fishes"" accompanying me can form an eternal form like machinery. So, I gave the fish a semi- mechanized half-life form and let them live in a space full of hope and light. I want to pass this project to the public. In today's fast-growing technology and economy, people's ""spiritual sustenance"" is also an important part of building a non-material level of society. 

In this work, I use the sci- fi concept and traditional Chinese aesthetics to explore the ultimate expression of life with the uncertainty of fish and ink. Many people think that the end of life may leave with the demise of the flesh. However, I think in the future, the form of existence of life may leave the flesh and exist in the form of semi-mechanized and semi-life, but it will eventually be completely separated from any form of support.

I am interested in the symbology behind transformation in myth and folkloristic tales, which can be the manifestation of an individual’s inner conflict, as well as signify the process of transition from an immature form to an adult one, or the passage into a more or less spiritual state.

This installation work takes on the form of interactive and participatory art as a means to spark curiosity and conversations. Childhood and play are the work's main focus', contemplating how creativity is often inhibited from an early age due to societal expectations of how children should behave. My installation of the television, an everyday household object, invites the public to interact with it through the mediums of drawing and writing, in a manner that would typically be disciplined in childhood; set up in a public area, passers-by were able to stop and consider each other's scrawls, taking inspiration from one another and forming unspoken conversations between each other. There is a sense of transformation that takes place through this; both the object into an artwork and the adult back into the child. This work encouraged the participants to explore their creativity, via the installation, which is all too often suppressed in adult life.",skyewilliamsstudio@gmail.com,www.curatorspace.com/artists/skyewilliams,www.instagram.com/sw.fineart,2020-05-14 17:12:27,2020-05-14 17:35:47,25c20003b8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,1

One of my most vivid childhood memories is of my mother, making flour and water paste, so I could collage chocolate biscuit wrappers. 

Recognising that my strengths lie in the analogue, collage enables me to take a playful and diverse approach to making work which is therefore eclectic, often conceptual. Influenced by Surrealism, Dada and Pop Art, I combine collage with elements of appropriated paintings and readymade objects. As I mature past the age of 50, I am acutely aware of the value of recycling and the satisfaction of giving a ‘thing’ a second life, a reflection perhaps of my own reinvention as a student.

Adjusting to life in lockdown in response to the Coronavirus pandemic, I am fortunate to be able to continue making work. These five second-hand wall hangings came from a reclamation company, and I suspect, originally from a restaurant or a hotel. In reality each board measures 141 cm wide x 26 cm high x 6 cm deep and they stack to form a combined work inspired by the Surrealist game of exquisite corpse.

I would welcome the opportunity to see the work reproduced larger than life on a billboard. Not just because Covid-19 has robbed us of our degree shows but because the location of said billboard would affect the reading of the work in interesting ways. For instance, outside the British Museum the work reads as a classical frieze, yet outside Harvey Nichols it reads more as a glossy fashion advert.",krisstones@hotmail.com,https://aa2a.biz/network/user/christine19,https://www.instagram.com/krissstones/,2020-05-14 14:16:22,2020-05-14 17:24:28,2dda8bdea2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Gaia’s pixel amount is 50% smaller than a normal typeface. Therefore, the amount of electricity and ink is around 50% less too.

My final year project focused on the design of an at-home balance-improving solution to help adults aged 65+ overcome the fear of falling. This is a large health problem, experienced by 50% of community dwelling elderly, and can cause many to unnecessarily restrict their daily activity; this in turn can lead to a range of physical and psychological adverse health implications.

Tilt has been designed to help long-term balance improvement be more achievable and attainable. It comprises of two products which work in harmony with one another – the user practices their balance exercises by standing on pressure-sensitive foot soles; this data is sent to a speaker which gives live feedback to the user, telling them how to improve their balance and redistribute their weight. The emotive voice and personified wobbling movement of the speaker is intended to make the interaction engaging and stimulating; the goal is that it will make their practice enjoyable and increase the likelihood of the activity being integrated into their daily routine. With its consistent use, the solution has the potential to improve leaning balance, build self-confidence and contribute towards an increased quality of life.",hshowat@googlemail.com,https://www.behance.net/hshowatb5e,,2020-05-14 12:46:04,2020-05-14 14:09:39,a6a448de3a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,1

As I get older, I forget that everyone around me is ageing alongside me. I was jolted into
reality by my aging father and the life changing event that occurred to him. When Youth and
I Lived Together examines the impact of my father’s forced retirement on him but also on
my family.

In early 2001, my father was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and was prescribed strong
medication to manage the pain of the condition. Over the past 19 years, the medication’s
effectiveness has subsided to the point that my father was not able to work any longer due
to excruciating pain.

To document this change, I capture the evidence of changes within the household and the
gaps that aging presents to my entire family. These gaps come in the form of the negative
financial impact of the loss of income as well as the emotional effects of losing the ability to
work. I am also looking at the domestic space which is now filled with someone who was
absent while working most of his life. This added figure, who is now constant within the
domestic setting changes the balance significantly. While this is an autobiographical story
about my family, ageing and the feeling of being isolated when becoming retired is a
universal reality that touches everyone.",joannap1234@hotmail.co.uk,www.joannapenney.co.uk,@joannapenneyphotography,2020-05-14 13:37:45,2020-05-14 14:08:50,3b3db04bbb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

I had been debating with some friends and family about what's appropriate and what isn’t, not everyone is in the same situation economically, not everyone is lucky enough to have a full fridge every week, some people are not living in houses, some families have lost some relatives….
I tried avoiding the idea of death and negativity within my design and these were some factors that I took into consideration. I also tried maintaining my work from my personal experiences given that all my designs tell my story this past year.
My first three illustrations show Mercedes, Claudia and myself at different airports travelling back home wearing the masks.
I then decided to represent myself working from home, using a screenshot of my Instagram page within my illustration.
I looked carefully at the information shown on the hand's sanitisers at home, looked for free PNGs to use on my bottles and added color. The information on my bottles is in Spanish, which makes it more relevant to me as an international student combining English and my first language in my work.
This design is different from the rest because I worked harder on giving the right information to my audience by adding type.
Some of the type is in red to make the titles stand out on a yellow background to portray the message of danger and how important it is to follow the rules.
I used the same technique on the illustration of my mum driving wearing a mask and gloves. The information provided in this design, are the only reasons why people should be using their cars during the outbreak.
I also thought that I would draw my friends and I having a google hangout video call playing a scape room online. I worked harder on the icons of the call instead of on the people I was representing. 
Some of the feedback obtained was that this design was interesting due to the tension and bleakness of the subject and strangely disturbing because of how different to the 'joie-de-vivre' that inform my other images.",yackechuchialma@gmail.com,https://yackechuchialma.myportfolio.com/,@yackeagraphics,2020-05-14 9:34:40,2020-05-14 9:43:33,e2d84ec221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,1

Compared to the other collages of Spain, ke bar is a design during the night time whereas I had only previously worked with day and afternoon designs.
Another difference is that on this occasion this design was during winter, where I had to work more on the clothing. 
While working on ke bar I concluded that during winter, the majority of people stick to greys, blacks, and dark tones instead of bright colours.
In this design I decided to work harder on the facial expressions, hair, on the detail in the leaves, the Christmas lights on the roof of the bar, ice cubes and other smaller details.
I felt it was challenging to work with such dark tones for the clothing having already so much black to represent the night. I changed a few of the original tones to lighter colours to have some more variety and not cause the clothing to blend with the background.
This occasion was a special gathering after months of not being together as a group because we all study and work in different locations, we had been planning and looking forward to this event not only cause we were a few days off Christmas Eve, but because we were going to play secret Santa during dinner, make an effort to look smart and then go out to have a few drinks and catch up face to face.
I thought that my designs were too summery and I was sending the wrong idea to people who had never been to Spain and believed that it was always sunny and hot. This was the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that we also have winter back at home.",yackechuchialma@gmail.com,https://yackechuchialma.myportfolio.com/,@yackeagraphics,2020-05-14 9:19:22,2020-05-14 9:34:12,e2d84ec221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,1

This collage is made of seven illustrations.
When I began this collage, I decided I would add speech bubbles to some of my drawings, I had to make the decision of who and what they would be saying. My intention was to make it as personal, relevant, and significant to the specific day, the personality of my friend, and give an appropriate message to communicate throughout my work.
Trocadero is probably one of my favourites designs, not only I enjoyed making it, but it also made me work harder on exploring typography, thinking about perspective, different ways of adding ornaments to the piece and playing with pattern making. The cocktails and the boat were changed from the realistic versions, after printing it once I decided it was also missing a few seagulls considering we were at the beach.
I worked hard on the composition of the flamingo shirt, the small iPhone details in white and some of the other clothing details.

Where is home, really? Will we ever get there? Are we there right now without knowing it, and will we ever? By piecing together details of homes past through painting, drawing, collage and playing with transparencies, my end goal was to create a larger animated piece, stringing memories from these living spaces together that can speak to other immigrants or anyone that has ever questioned where home is. 
My family’s current apartment was always a stopping point between where we used to be and where we once will be, never a final point or final destination, there never was a feeling of fully “settling down.” New York is particular to this experience in terms of its shifting permanence, and further made me want to address the occurrence of feeling like a foreigner in your own home.

Large artificial earth mounds sing their lament, as sites of grittiness and sources of life, places of burial and regrowth. Their tragedy as phoneys
mirrors the short falls of rose-tinted recollection. From these mounds I watered and nurtured small seedlings uprooted from home, encouraging their growth from this site of artificiality, to eventually then rot and decay. Woven from personal sounds, such as mum’s breath through the clarinet and microphones inside my mouth, the sound piece creates perspective with distant foghorns, tram track sounds and birds such as the turtledove- a declining species in Britain. Deflecting trepidation of growing up and wilting - like plants, I harboured nostalgia, reminiscing and idolising childhood. These memories, shaped by their sounds, are both distant and intimate. This piece reflects my continued exploration into sounds as metaphors, expressing the chasm between reality and reflection, prompted by Wordsworth's The Prelude. It questions what’s natural and what’s artificial about memory. Wide, impersonal landscapes devoid of human presence cast against sounds created by intimate moments ebb and flow, repeating the rhythm of memory recall that’s further echoed by the mounds' sinuous folds.",eleanor.beale@yahoo.com,www.eleanorbeale.com,@elliebbeale,2020-05-13 10:19:56,2020-05-13 11:10:24,9ef8be32f7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,1

My story shows the struggle between two characters: the Man and the Bird. The narrative is circular - the end brings you back to the beginning, and the book can be read both backwards and forwards. The story is interpretative and can be seen to represent many things, including the cycle of life and death and their symbiosis, humans' relationship with nature, or the concepts of good and evil or light and dark. I created the imagery manually, by drawing and using monoprint techniques, which I then stitched together digitally to create the final illustrations.

considered truly either. The collection also takes a serious tone, evoking guests to think about society, with the name
“Spot The Real Thug” taken from an article in the 1980s, on how to spot a football hooligan
simply by how they dress. The quote “the bovver-booted model on the left looks ready for a
punch-up but the casually dressed model on the right is wearing the new disguise”, inspired
the designer to look at how in society, black men are statistically more likely to be accused of
committing a crime simply by how they look, rather than what they’re doing. A topic the
designer feels strongly about, after the death of Trayvon Martin and the way the case was
handled.",gloria@glrgnynk.com,www.GLRGNYNK.com,@GLRGNYNK,2020-05-12 10:29:18,2020-05-12 10:31:44,95b297f723,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

With everything that is happening at this moment in time, there has been a glimmer of light in which the climate has proved it can heal. We must be mindful of this as we come out of isolation someday in the future.",stockers11@hotmail.com,https://www.instagram.com/design_george_stockley/,@design_george_stockley,2020-05-12 9:26:44,2020-05-12 9:34:08,2be11eb47d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,1

On one side, the feeling that all our certainties are collapsing and the necessity to self-isolate and adopt social distancing. On the other side, the reflection upon our impact on the environment, full of waste like plastic, which is slowly breaking into our own biology. In the end, the possibility to express ideas through creativity, imagination and arts, in order to reconsider our life in relation to our connection to the planet.

Though respecting the unification and inclusivity Shrovetide brings – alongside its aggressive nature, I question the line between tradition and patriarchal dominance in allowing men to temporary fulfil their desired image of masculinity. In particular with younger generations and the rise of challenging the norms of gender, will they emulate what the past has told them to do?",dommanderson@gmail.com,https://dominicmanderson.com/,@dommanderson,2020-05-10 11:39:41,2020-05-10 13:02:50,ada9a9cbd5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,1

The starting point for this project was the legacy of conflict in Northern Ireland and the impact that can still be felt today. This is particularly notable within the male population and is discussed by Karen Nickel in her thesis.  She says that women were concerned about their “menfolk” who were, “hiding their emotions behind an angry silence”.  As a textile designer I wanted to communicate, albeit abstractly, some of the emotion and energy that surrounds things that have gone unsaid. Through a process led exploration of materials, I developed an experimental yet methodical design approach to the development of colour, pattern and structure.

Bike hire schemes are often dull and uninspiring. Bright Hire was created with the intention that it couldn't be overlooked. Brighton is a quirky, colourful and unapologetically different coastal treasure. To honour this individuality, our scheme draws on the distinct visual aesthetic of the iconic Brighton stick of rock. Throughout the identity, rocky textures and stripes fill the illustrations, Pride-inspired wavy rainbows flood the posters and playful copy related to 'rock', 'roll' and 'bright' create a happy and confident tone of voice. The identity spreads across uniquely Brighton touchpoints, such as a photo stand-in on the pier; Bright Hire also has it's own rock-inspired route system.

It is an iced tea, which can be taken to work, the gym, or wherever you may need a little energy boost. Giving your day a little bit more 'Moxi' (which means full of energy / creativity).

The Guayusa leaf is bursting with health benefits, which makes this drink a perfect alternative to the unhealthy caffeinated fizzy drinks and energy drinks we see on supermarket shelves today.

Inspired by the colourful patterns worn by the Kichwa Community of Ecuador, where Guayusa leaf is harvested, the packaging features an eye-catching, bold and energetic design.",emily@emilyfrith.co.uk,https://www.instagram.com/emilyfrithdesign/,@emilyfrithdesign,2020-05-07 11:24:16,2020-05-07 12:03:06,be721aca3c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,1
