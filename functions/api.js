This collection of work became a way to explore and cope with the personal loss of a family member, and discover how something negative can be used to fuel a show of beauty, in memory and in an educational form, understanding grief and the possibility of an afterlife. Exploring the use of paper folding techniques, the re-birth of old/discarded work into new 3-dimensional forms displays a new life after what could have been the end for the 2-dimensional work it was formed from. Inspired by the story of ‘The Secret of the Dragonfly’, this work is aiming to give hope to those grieving, whilst also supplying an immersive escapism area, where the broken is free to fly. This project paved the way for an exploration across a wide range of multi-disciplinary art techniques, pulling apart 2-dimensional forms in order to change its dimensional value.\\r\\nThis response shows the delicacy, but also the poignancy of life and judgement, how one may see the end or the break of something, another may notice a growing potential.

My Dad, Tony, suffers with an illness called hydrocephalus, which causes him to build up too much fluid in the brain. 25 years ago Dad went in for an operation to put a hole in his head that would allow the liquid to flow. However, during the operation his short-term memory was accidentally damaged, permanently leaving him with a unique short term memory difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dog’s in the Car is a collaboration \\u0003between the artist and her father.

Having birthed the likes of The Smiths, Oasis and New Order, the city is known for being a hub for all genres of music, with these iconic names in British pop culture not only putting Manchester on the map, but also paving the way for future generations. New emerging artists prove that Manchester’s music scene continues to thrive, rightfully earning its status as the music capital of the UK. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2019, The Institute for Public Policy Research released a report labelling Manchester’s pollution levels as “lethal and illegal”. With this in mind, how can we combine the city’s love of music with a more sustainable mode of transport to tackle Manchester’s air quality crisis?\\r\\n\\r\\nIntroducing 45RPM, Manchester’s revolutionary bike hire scheme in partnership with Spotify – celebrating the city’s rich music culture – past, present and the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith its name deriving from the most common vinyl single, the 45 (and the records’ revolutions per minute) this dock-based hire scheme encourages an innovative and safe inner-city cycling experience with its fun, pedal-powered musical bikes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo how does it work? At the turn of the bike wheel, music will be played aloud, the song’s tempo determined by the cyclist’s speed and revolutions of the pedals. Simply, the faster the pedalling, the faster the song. This ensures the recommended inner-city cycling speed is always maintained, providing a safe environment for all.","website":"claudiaaggett.com","instagram":"@designby.claudia","categories":["graphic"],"width":4033,"height":2481,"ratio":1.6255542120112858,"colour":"#948e7e","file_name":"gujo6th0xdovxxugyijgujo6thiff74p.jpg","thumb_name":"gujo6th0xdovxxugyijgujo6thiff74p.jpg"},{"id":"6orsarwulvmpan21iflw6ors0rmej13x","name":"Molly Whitt","description":"This is a close up shot of a scene from my third year Look Development Project.","website":"mollyewhitt.weebly.com","instagram":"molliartsie","categories":["animation"],"width":1280,"height":720,"ratio":1.7777777777777777,"colour":"#6c9c9c","file_name":"6orsarwulvmpan21iflw6ors0rmej13x.png","thumb_name":"6orsarwulvmpan21iflw6ors0rmej13x.jpg"},{"id":"jgn1wjujx4mw5qjss0jxjgn13a4kpycj","name":"Georgia Bolton","description":"‘Terms of Disservice’ is a broadsheet newsprint of Facebook’s data policy in response to a dissertation questioning ‘how graphic design be a disruptive force\\r\\nfor social change?’ It uses typography and editorial distortions to highlight the manipulative tactics in online data collection.","website":"","instagram":"@geebee_art","categories":["graphic"],"width":6720,"height":4480,"ratio":1.5,"colour":"#926d62","file_name":"jgn1wjujx4mw5qjss0jxjgn13a4kpycj.jpg","thumb_name":"jgn1wjujx4mw5qjss0jxjgn13a4kpycj.jpg"},{"id":"dm0uayq4z72rcopgqoqkdm0u2qn0ibei","name":"Nure Abbas","description":"Finding out if digital clothing has the potential to reduce physical clothing waste consumption in the future","website":"","instagram":"","categories":["fashion"],"width":3508,"height":2306,"ratio":1.5212489158716391,"colour":"#84645c","file_name":"dm0uayq4z72rcopgqoqkdm0u2qn0ibei.jpg","thumb_name":"dm0uayq4z72rcopgqoqkdm0u2qn0ibei.jpg"},{"id":"ot4u3m7uji4pqt9qj5phjot4u3m7c9y6","name":"Nicole Hall","description":"I am inspired by everyday happenings, emotions and the seemingly banal.

Having grown up watching Star Trek and nature documentaries she explores the unknown and what the world could look like in a post-apocalyptic, post human future. Coming from Derbyshire which is the birth place of the industrial revolution Maycock has an interest in the Anthropocene and her work raises concerns over the effect humanity has had on the planet during this period of geological time and what it could mean to the world in the future.  Creating sculptural maquettes out of circuit boards she uses computer software to give these films a science fiction edge. Maycock then uses large scale projections to show her moving image pieces thus playing with scale. Informed by her love of reading science fiction writers such as J. G.

Throughout Paradiso, especially within the 33rd Canto, Dante uses the imagery of light repeatedly as a metaphor for Heaven and uses the brightest light as a representation of when he meets God Himself.  Light and dark (shadow) has been used frequently throughout history to represent heaven and hell; good and bad. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis design is based around the idea of using light and shadow to read the text from the 33rd Canto in Paradiso.  The lampshade is attached to a ceiling fitting or light stand and, once the light is switched on, the text is projected onto the nearby walls surrounding the consumer with the Canto thereby transporting the reader into the representation of Paradise.","website":"https://tiacollis.myportfolio.com/work","instagram":"tia_collis_designs","categories":["graphic"],"width":3508,"height":2480,"ratio":1.414516129032258,"colour":"#7d7778","file_name":"vkg7dvubo2epxenvkg7obyq2ty1cn9vh.jpg","thumb_name":"vkg7dvubo2epxenvkg7obyq2ty1cn9vh.jpg"},{"id":"lqzq8t6p4p57009ajb0ijzk7qlqzq8t5","name":"Mattie Amatt","description":"My work explores the tactile relationship we have with the land.

This is apparent in all ages of development as the taboo of speaking about anything other than basic wants is carried through to adulthood.

One area is single use plastics and overall plastic pollution. To combat this catastrophic effect on our environment, focusing on the ocean landscape, I developed an innovative bioplastic, utilising sweets. This material is completely biodegradable yet strong and versatile. Along with inspiration from the plastic crisis, I was inspired to create a circular design collection based on the idea of lost jewellery found lying on the ground. Being biodegradable, if my jewellery were to fall on the ground it would completely breakdown and return back into the earth, thus is assisting in contributing to solving the pollution problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the “Sweet Bioplastic” I created, I was conscious of the material choices within the pieces. For the items that incorporated metal I used Eco-Silver, which is made from 100% recycled and scrap silver products thus environmentally friendly. By combining science and craftsmanship I wanted to create items to help, not hinder the world around us through the use and reuse of sustainable materials.","website":"https://www.etsy.com/ie/shop/MeganHamiltonDesigns","instagram":"@megan_hamilton9","categories":["ceramics","jewellery"],"width":2896,"height":2896,"ratio":1,"colour":"#559489","file_name":"crls2pe8knao8ql70cucrlsh9djhz793.jpg","thumb_name":"crls2pe8knao8ql70cucrlsh9djhz793.jpg"},{"id":"prx0ejyd7gv07cfz7i1nyxiimprx0ejy","name":"lily dean","description":"I started with the idea of Medusa turning herself to stone by her own reflection. As I researched the story further, I was drawn to the visual impact of the headless figure of Medusa. I also wanted to expand my sculptures to a full-size figure. I was very interested in Medusa, a bronze sculpture made by Benvenuto Cellini 1545–1554. I wanted to eliminate it but also subvert the misogyny and violence in it so Medusa is reclaiming her own power of her severed head, The idea of reflection plays an important part of the myth and I have cultivated it in my art pieces to create a sense of interaction, I replaced the face with a mirror - The idea is this makes it an interactive/performative element because you as the audience become the artwork. In the title I\'m playing with what is perceived to be “real\'\' and what is ‘stone’ or sculpt. What is alive and what is dead. Though the casting process, I destroyed or killed the original ( clay version) and yet, it came back to me in a brilliant ghostly white as though it were an apparition. Both a reference to the Greek myth, where Medusa was beheaded, only to lose the life of her body whilst her head continued to be used as a weapon, but also a reference to a digital age, where because of VR and modern advancements both in art-making, but also in a wider context of technology -it is becoming only the brain that is used, the is body obsolete.","website":"https://www.instagram.com/lily.dean.art/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/lily.dean.art/","categories":["fine_art"],"width":4032,"height":3024,"ratio":1.3333333333333333,"colour":"#ac926d","file_name":"prx0ejyd7gv07cfz7i1nyxiimprx0ejy.jpg","thumb_name":"prx0ejyd7gv07cfz7i1nyxiimprx0ejy.jpg"},{"id":"x762mg7h1kux9sqa39wtx762hgnjmxjr","name":"Martha Waters","description":"These are two costumes I made for my concept of a TV series called \'Pink Rabbit\'. \'Pink Rabbit\' tells the story of Judith Kerr and her family escaping Nazi Germany in the 1930s.

The title, Everything Is Interesting And Anything Is Possible, refers to  exactly this, this excess and abundance. Having realized the bountiful existences of interesting things and possibilities, has been about as terrifying as it has been motivating. As much as it might inspire or fuel any creation, it calls for a strategy, a direction, a narrowing down of things and for making choices. This has been the leading agenda for this project.

As a person of Singaporean and British heritage my practice engages with the colonial connotations of the relationship between the East and West. This is most evident in themes such as Orientalism and the Chinoiserie in which elements of Chinese design were re-imagined in relation to European aesthetics and tastes. My practice touches upon this collision of cultures, both on a personal and political level. \\r\\nThis year I have been creating furniture-like structures. Combining motifs and imagery from Chinese and European furniture design, I attempt to somewhat re-imagine and reclaim these practices that have had problematic colonial undertones. Cultural designs are shared as opposed to appropriated. These objects are composed of a combination brightly coloured MDF and light reflecting materials such as acrylic, often strung with silky fabrics. \\r\\nAn important element of my practice relates to the functionality of these objects, experimenting with functional flat-pack design has become quite a playful process. This experimentation results in peculiar yet dynamic transformations of seemingly simple furniture structures. Playing with light and shadow enables each structure to be seen in a new way, the cut out design of each furniture piece lends itself to this kind of experimentation, where the shadows created by a setting sun or coloured light often complete the work.","website":"https://www.hannah-lim.co.uk/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/__hannahlim__/","categories":["sculpture"],"width":3456,"height":5184,"ratio":0.6666666666666666,"colour":"#4eb179","file_name":"gyslw7n9jnbbj7otid2degysv0pi7r2x.jpg","thumb_name":"gyslw7n9jnbbj7otid2degysv0pi7r2x.jpg"},{"id":"lpvomlejg9zng7e5mh2dlpvow8f8xyta","name":"Regina Jambor","description":"This is an illustration inspired byEmpire of Sand, a fantasy novel by Tasha Suri.

Clotho, the larger pink one is an expression of my chronic illnesses. The repetitive stitching all over the piece reflects the daily, life-long pain I deal with, both my physical, bodily pain, and the wider impacts of my conditions; changes to my social life, the way I am perceived, interactions with strangers and difficulties I face using mobility aids. Lachesis, the black piece, is chronic depression another experience I deal with on a daily basis. They are sisters to me, each one having the capacity to worsen each other, often coming hand in hand. This work bears down upon the room, weighing on your shoulders as it suspends from a bar across the ceiling. Finally, Atropos addresses a not-much-discussed phenomena - the existence of disabled people as sexual entities. In most regards I am like any other 21-year-old woman, including my sexuality. Yet I am still met with shock and confusion when I speak about enjoying sex, every Tinder date I go on leads to; \\"so... why do you need a wheelchair?\\". I am seen as a useless, sexless lump, discarded on the floor. The opportunity to be sexual or vulnerable only seems the same when I leave my disability at the door, swapping my wheelchair or cane to walking unaided, concealing my struggle and identity to pretend I am \\"normal\\" - see, ablebodied - for a night. So my choice of sheer voile reflects that vulnerability, parodies my deception, or privacy, depending on how you see it, and reveals the same lumpy pink flesh we all have inside, coated by a seminal veil.","website":"https://www.instagram.com/delphicampbell/?hl=en","instagram":"@delphicampbell","categories":["fine_art"],"width":1753,"height":1275,"ratio":1.3749019607843138,"colour":"#ad575e","file_name":"c12bs05r7zitha5gc12bs3h575izox0u.jpg","thumb_name":"c12bs05r7zitha5gc12bs3h575izox0u.jpg"},{"id":"p7bb3qs2ue053f35cnv5gop7bb3q8lss","name":"Abigail Talbot","description":"I have created an in-store and digital collaborative campaign between Monki and Rainforest Alliance, whereby 10% of the profits from #monkicares ethical clothing range will be donated to the charity, encouraging the consumer to \'feel good, shop good\' and \'love ethical garms\'.

My first-round tropical fish breeder in northern China. I specialize in artificial breeding and disease control of tropical fish for Pterophyllum. I am eager to extend the meaning of the influence of spiritual support on individuals. In the works, I tried to combine the linear expression of Chinese traditional painting techniques with the mechanical form, hoping to convey surrealism with oriental characteristics through the works. I hope that these \\"fishes\\" accompanying me can form an eternal form like machinery. So, I gave the fish a semi- mechanized half-life form and let them live in a space full of hope and light. I want to pass this project to the public. In today\'s fast-growing technology and economy, people\'s \\"spiritual sustenance\\" is also an important part of building a non-material level of society. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this work, I use the sci- fi concept and traditional Chinese aesthetics to explore the ultimate expression of life with the uncertainty of fish and ink. Many people think that the end of life may leave with the demise of the flesh.

Influenced by Surrealism, Dada and Pop Art, I combine collage with elements of appropriated paintings and readymade objects.

These five second-hand wall hangings came from a reclamation company, and I suspect, originally from a restaurant or a hotel.

It comprises of two products which work in harmony with one another – the user practices their balance exercises by standing on pressure-sensitive foot soles; this data is sent to a speaker which gives live feedback to the user, telling them how to improve their balance and redistribute their weight. The emotive voice and personified wobbling movement of the speaker is intended to make the interaction engaging and stimulating; the goal is that it will make their practice enjoyable and increase the likelihood of the activity being integrated into their daily routine. With its consistent use, the solution has the potential to improve leaning balance, build self-confidence and contribute towards an increased quality of life.","website":"https://www.behance.net/hshowatb5e","instagram":"","categories":["product"],"width":4007,"height":2829,"ratio":1.416401555319901,"colour":"#84847c","file_name":"bc31gtr3w9dhe4pirkr6bc31gtvpku1j.jpg","thumb_name":"bc31gtr3w9dhe4pirkr6bc31gtvpku1j.jpg"},{"id":"tdww15gm6o6yde0dgtdwwyia4rbbuswf","name":"Nella Piatek","description":"This project draws attention to how our environment influences our behavioural habits and makes a statement that wellbeing and future thinking should no longer be a luxury.

Their tragedy as phoneys\\r\\nmirrors the short falls of rose-tinted recollection. From these mounds I watered and nurtured small seedlings uprooted from home, encouraging their growth from this site of artificiality, to eventually then rot and decay. Woven from personal sounds, such as mum’s breath through the clarinet and microphones inside my mouth, the sound piece creates perspective with distant foghorns, tram track sounds and birds such as the turtledove- a declining species in Britain. Deflecting trepidation of growing up and wilting - like plants, I harboured nostalgia, reminiscing and idolising childhood. These memories, shaped by their sounds, are both distant and intimate. This piece reflects my continued exploration into sounds as metaphors, expressing the chasm between reality and reflection, prompted by Wordsworth\'s The Prelude. It questions what’s natural and what’s artificial about memory. Wide, impersonal landscapes devoid of human presence cast against sounds created by intimate moments ebb and flow, repeating the rhythm of memory recall that’s further echoed by the mounds\' sinuous folds.","website":"www.eleanorbeale.com","instagram":"@elliebbeale","categories":["fine_art"],"width":5130,"height":3420,"ratio":1.5,"colour":"#917a63","file_name":"u10hgjoyfg73r7v9u10h269x5c8dtkef.jpg","thumb_name":"u10hgjoyfg73r7v9u10h269x5c8dtkef.jpg"},{"id":"zd4y2owhpw1zd4y20b7zb3smvhh3uolz","name":"Aaron Atkinson","description":"The poster series was part of campaign that focuses on the awareness of and the active conversation of mens mental health. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe poster series uses a modular gird system to represent order and guidance in receiving help, contrasting serif and sans-serif typography demonstrating the idea of confusion sufferers may feel and three different colour gradients that play on the idea of colour theory and emotional responses and perception humans have to colour.","website":"https://aadesignstud.com/","instagram":"@aa._designstud","categories":["graphic"],"width":3000,"height":1875,"ratio":1.6,"colour":"#9f6284","file_name":"zd4y2owhpw1zd4y20b7zb3smvhh3uolz.png","thumb_name":"zd4y2owhpw1zd4y20b7zb3smvhh3uolz.jpg"},{"id":"0y7sx1ejnw9migb4t0y7s4xlzpflew7w","name":"Nancy Root","description":"A concept… Bump is a new arrival to the world of alcohol-free drinking, benefitting those pregnant or breastfeeding.

This is particularly notable within the male population and is discussed by Karen Nickel in her thesis.  She says that women were concerned about their “menfolk” who were, “hiding their emotions behind an angry silence”.  As a textile designer I wanted to communicate, albeit abstractly, some of the emotion and energy that surrounds things that have gone unsaid. Through a process led exploration of materials, I developed an experimental yet methodical design approach to the development of colour, pattern and structure. I then created a collection that plays on the jarring and discordant which explores unknown narratives prominently. I have showcased the fabrics as contemporary, high end Menswear.","website":"https://www.instagram.com/laurenpatchett.textiles/?hl=en","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/laurenpatchett.textiles/?hl=en","categories":["textile"],"width":5184,"height":3456,"ratio":1.5,"colour":"#9c7c65","file_name":"3zxuq6i3yq6lhlquqt3uelcigfa8kulh.jpg","thumb_name":"3zxuq6i3yq6lhlquqt3uelcigfa8kulh.jpg"},{"id":"o4m0ihkjqr9n1lfs2xkwpo4m0ihiysec","name":"Nicole McLaughlin","description":"Knitted Glass is based on a poem that was written by a Dundee Student - Hannah Whaley.

Brighton is a quirky, colourful and unapologetically different coastal treasure. To honour this individuality, our scheme draws on the distinct visual aesthetic of the iconic Brighton stick of rock. Throughout the identity, rocky textures and stripes fill the illustrations, Pride-inspired wavy rainbows flood the posters and playful copy related to \'rock\', \'roll\' and \'bright\' create a happy and confident tone of voice. The identity spreads across uniquely Brighton touchpoints, such as a photo stand-in on the pier; Bright Hire also has it\'s own rock-inspired route system. In collaboration with Lucy & Yak, Bright Hire would produce limited edition rock-striped apparel. Our identity is a celebration of the quirky, colourful and anything-goes attitude of Brighton. Bright Hire is as vibrant as the city, because Brighton rocks!","website":"","instagram":"@ellaflooddesign","categories":["graphic"],"width":4961,"height":3508,"ratio":1.4141961231470923,"colour":"#5e899c","file_name":"haqd223eeoepq0yhae4f1p8e86b0dyqj.jpg","thumb_name":"haqd223eeoepq0yhae4f1p8e86b0dyqj.jpg"},{"id":"53j9152nimijmr3fz4a53j9sa7j0rdwi","name":"Natasha Crudgington","description":"Bellywash is a charcoal shot created for the health drink sector.
